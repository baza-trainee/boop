      "paragraph_2": "Everyone can awaken the clown within themselves - a unique, interesting, funny character who not only explores the world around them but is also ready to dive into the unknown. This is the foundation with which they can work and visit the wards to see children.",
      "paragraph_3": "After the training, volunteers go to practice in the hospital, accompanied by experienced hospital clowns.",
      "paragraph_4": "Over the next three months, they meet for classes once a week and delve deeper into the mechanisms of hospital clowning.",
      "paragraph_5": "In parallel, regular visits to hospital wards occur under constant trainer supervision and psychological support."
